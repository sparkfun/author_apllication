Hi there!
My name is __Rishabh__ and I am presently enrolled for a Masters in Electrical Engineering at University of Colorado Boulder.
Apart from being a Graduate student, I am also a relentless tinkerer. I have worked on a number of projects both for school and for myself.
</p>
<p>
I like making projects that make things in my life simpler in some way or the other.
I feel bad that I have not documented my projects properly in the past. I used to get excited after I got the project working and never thought if documenting it.
I thought I would never need it again.
But now when I want to revisit my old projects to see what I made and how I made it that time, I do not have much information to get a good picture.
It would have been fascinating to see projects by an 18 year old me and compare them with my projects now. It would demonstrate certain things about how my thinking process would have changed along the time and yet some things would still be the same.
</p>
<p>
So I have started documenting all my projects from now on and it has been fruitful. There is also a plus side to it, you can share the knowledge with the world.
The Open Source Community is ever growing and is so helpful for young makers like myself.
</p>
<p>
I have published several papers in technical conferences in the past. One of my most recent and favorite project is the Smart Home system using Amazon Echo. I have implemented a wireless sensor network with both BLE and WiFi.
There is an Intel Edison and Raspberry Pi Communicating using BLE (Bluez library for python) with my peripherals(Sensor based tags or dev boards). I have also used the Particle Photon as a WiFi based sensor hub to send sensor data. All the data is collected, processed and then pushed to the cloud. I used ThingSpeak by Mathworks as my IoT platform. After getting the data I can create trigger points. Like sending an alert through SMS (twilio) or Twitter etc. I also Integrated Alexa to work with it, I have created Alexa Skills to give me sensor values and hell even brew my coffee!
</p>
<p>
I would love to write tutorials for projects which coincide with Internet of Things or Wearable technologies. These are presently the topics that I am most enthralled and passionate about. There are infinite possibilities for projects in these areas and since they are fairly new technologies not much is out there to help people.
</p>
<p>
I love a lot of SparkFun products. While growing up in India was fun, we do not have companies like SparkFun spreading the Open Source love. I used to get a few SparkFun shields from my cousin every year from the States. It helped me make and learn so many things as a young maker.
But, presently I would have to say I love the Lilypad line of SparkFun products. I have used them extensively in my Wearables Class. I would have to say the Lilypad Simblee is my favorite amongst all the Lilypad products.
</p>
<p>
I think SparkFun tutorials are very well documented. It has been easy for me to follow them and complete a project. I do believe adding videos for more projects along with the written documentation (like Makezine) would be a good idea.
Also for third party products like Simblee, the updates keep rolling frequently and the tutorials should follow that. I had trouble installing the library for Simblee as they had made a new one for the latest version of Arduino, but the tutorial covered the old one.
</p>
<p>
I even love writing in my spare time, this is apart from documentation. I am sharing one of latest notes I have written. Its called Chaos of Harmony. I hope you like it.
</p>

<h5>Chaos of Harmony

<p>
The String theory states that everything around us, including us can be broken down to a 1 dimensional string.
Forget all the complicated multi dimensional world that surrounds us, which constantly amazes us all in one way or another. We ourselves are convoluted multi dimensional beings.
I cannot help but think about the beauty of it, as it helps us peel those labyrinthine veils that makes us who we are and tries to show the million dimensions that we are made of.
</p>
<p>
Now, the theory also states these 1 dimensional things aren’t really static in nature. They are never at rest. They are ever vibrating, restless indivisible loci of energies. So every vibrating thing in nature has a natural frequency associated with it, we’ve all probably been introduced to harmonics in our life, whether in form of physics, music or even chaos.
</p>
<p>
We being *beings* of such intricate nature can be replaced by a black box, which is nothing but a frequency generator and detector. We sweep through a range of frequencies well defined upon our dimension’s restlessness. These dimensions could be as small as a belief or as big as a doubt. Everything that you stand for, believe in or doubt and everything that you are, is trying to sing the song of your soul. With a million piece orchestra going in 'your' harmony. You are the maestro of your own soul. You drive it where you want to, creating your own music along the way.
</p>
<p>
Now the last thing is resonance, which is the phenomenon that causes an external system to oscillate with the vibrating systems frequency. This also comes with the sweet benefit of greater amplification. Its like opera singers singing in unison, making a beautiful melody of a life that not only reflects you but someone else as well.
</p>
<p>
Now someone’s harmony could be someones’s chaos. Its hard not to account this fact. When the frequencies do not match, rather than creating a resonated wave it could create distortions in the dimension of life itself. The dimension that all these wave propagate though. A distorted wave is the one, which is very dangerous as it misrepresents all the clashing ‘original' waves that led to its inception.
</p>
<p>
Doesn’t it make sense, to shape our lives towards finding people who, when come together give the ability to resonate the common song of their souls rather than clashing with those who are still looking for getting hitched and someone resonate with.
I would end this thought by saying if we stop looking for the chaos in other people’s harmony and try to pursue our harmony in all the chaos around and then hopefully they world would be a better place to live in.
</p>

Thank you for time. :)
